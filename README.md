# Movies-ETL

## Project Overview

Amazing Prime loves the dataset and wants to keep it updated on a daily basis. Britta needs your help to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. You’ll need to refactor the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database

## Goal

- Create an ETL pipeline from raw data to a SQL database.
- Extract data from disparate sources using Python.
- Clean and transform data using Pandas.
- Use regular expressions to parse data and to transform text into numbers.
- Load data with PostgreSQL.

# Deliverables

This new assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables. You will submit the following:

  Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
  Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
  Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
  Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database

# Results
The new ETL function performs correctly and the data is successfuly added to a PostgreSQL database as seen in the images below.
